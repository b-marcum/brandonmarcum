Welcome to my personal website. This site serves as a minimalist landing page to aggregate links to platforms and independently share content.

I have a natural curiosity that drives my strong passion for technology which I use to solve real world challenges for people and businesses every day.

I have a broad systems infrastructure background of 20+ years but my primary focus is around networking, security, automation, and observability that stitches the world together.

My current role is Senior Solutions Architect at [Presidio](https://www.presidio.com/), a global solutions provider.
