I live in the greater [Charlotte, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina) area the US but I'm originally from the [Hampton Roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Roads) region of Virginia.

My natural curiosity and desire to learn is what drives my strong passion for technology. I leverage this day-to-day to solve real world challenges for people and businesses in my current role as a Senior Solutions Architect at [Presidio](https://www.presidio.com/), the leading global digital services and solutions provider.

I have developed a broad IT infrastructure background over the past 20+ years. Today, my primary focus is in networking, security, automation, and observability.
