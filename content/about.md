I live in the greater [Charlotte, North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina) area of the United States.

My natural curiosity and desire to learn is what drives my strong passion for technology. I leverage this day-to-day to solve real world challenges for people and businesses.

I have a broad IT infrastructure background of 20+ years. Today, my primary focus is in data center/enterprise networking, automation, security, and observability.
