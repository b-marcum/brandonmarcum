Welcome to my personal website. This site serves as a minimalist landing page for aggregation of links to platforms and a place to independently share content.

I have a natural curiosity that drives a strong passion for technology which I use to solve real world challenges for people and businesses every day in my current role as a Senior Solutions Architect at [Presidio](https://www.presidio.com/), the leading global digital services and solutions provider.

I have a broad systems infrastructure background of 20+ years but my primary focus is on networking, security, automation, and observability that stitches the world together.
